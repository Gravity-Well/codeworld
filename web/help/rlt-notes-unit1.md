If you do not leave a space before and after the & the popup does not show
If the student makes change and clicks an example they get a warning. It might be beneficial to mention something about this and/or saving.

Should variable really be constant since you cannot re-assign it a new value?
Ex. program=xxx
nameTag=xxx
nameTag=yyy

Might want to mention the red x error shows when using a variable before it's defined.
